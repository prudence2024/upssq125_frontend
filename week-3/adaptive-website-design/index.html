    <h1>The difference between Responsive Web Design (RWD) and Adaptive Web Design (AWD)</h1>
    <p>The difference between Responsive Web Design (RWD) and Adaptive Web Design (AWD) lies in how they adjust layout and content for different screen sizes and devices.</p>

    <p>Responsive Web Design uses fluid layouts that automatically adjust and resize based on the screen size or device. It relies heavily on CSS media queries, flexible grids, and percent-based widths.The design responds in real-time to the screenâ€™s size. When the viewport changes (e.g., resizing a browser or switching to mobile), elements adjust fluidly to fit the available space. It uses one layout that scales and rearranges, based entirely on CSS Same HTML/CSS for all devices, adjusts seamlessly at any screen width. While Adaptive Web Design , When a user visits the site, the system detects the device (e.g., phone, tablet, desktop) and delivers the most suitable layout version.Uses predefined breakpoints (e.g., 480px, 768px, 1024px).it can involve both CSS and JavaScript and is often implemented with server-side logic and layouts snap rather than flow.</p>
