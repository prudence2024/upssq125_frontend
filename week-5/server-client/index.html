    <h2>Server-Client vs Client-Side Code</h2>
    <p>When you hear the term server-side and client-side code especially in the context of web development, client-side code is the code that runs on the user's computer <span>- When a webpage is viewed, the pages client-side code is downloaded then run and displayed by the browser. In this module we are explicitly talking on Client-side Javascript</span></p>
    <p>Server-side code on the other hand is runned on a server, then it's result are runned and displayed on a browser. Exaamples of webside server side language include Php, Python, Ruby, C# , Javascript. Javascript can also be used as a server-side language in the popular Node.js environment. You can find out more about node on node.js website.</p>

    <h3>Dynamic vs Static code</h3>
    <p>The word <strong>dynamic</strong> is used to describe both<i> client-side javascript and server-side javascript</i><span>-It refers to the ability to update the display of a webpage/app to show different things in differnt circumstances, generating new circumstances as required.</span> Server-side codes dynamically generate new contents on a server for example: pulling data from a dta base, hwereas clint-side javascript dynamically generates new content inside the browser on the client. Example: Creating a new html with table data requested from the server, then displaying the table in a webpage shown to the user. The meaning is slightly different in two context but related and both apppraches (server-side and client-side usually work together)</p>
    <br>
    <p>A webpage with no dynamically updating content is referred to as <strong>Static</strong><span> - It just shows the same content all the time.</span></p>
